I initially followed John Smilga's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asB-dUwpH4Y) to complete the foundational implementation. I'll be doing semi-regular blog posts about various topics which are interesting to me, likely consisting of general commentary or technicalities in the realm of computer science. I'm committed to maintaining and further developing this site in 2021, stay tuned for what is to come!\n\nThis site was made using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"inaugural-post"}}}
