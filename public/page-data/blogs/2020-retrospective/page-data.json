Here's a [timeline](https://time.graphics/line/386203), in case you forgot some of the craziness.\n\nThere were more reasons to stay home than ever, and as a result we watched the world go digital. Zoom became a substitute for the physical workplace, and by April they had logged [2 trillion](https://cloudwars.co/covid-19/zoom-quarter-10-eye-popping-stats-from-techs-new-superstar/)(!) meeting minutes. At times I felt like all of the 2 trillion minutes could be attributed to the time I spent on the app between school, internships, and side-work... \n\nDuring this time, I was able to complete two ten-week software development internships, join the [Dolomite](https://beta.dolomite.io/) team, code a plethora of my own projects (including this site), and connect with a massive network of individuals from all over the globe. \n\nI also utilized the resulting extra time to read amazing books, listen to a whole bunch of podcasts (my favorite being [Lex Fridman's](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/)), and dive into the depths of blockchain and machine learning. I'm pumped to continue the momentum into 2021.\n\nWhile this year brought a lot of negativity, I think there's just as much good to reflect on.  \nLike all things in life, 2020 had a dualism in nature, and it has me excited for what the remainder of the decade might hold. I think that when it's all said and done, the 2020's will be remembered as the real 'Roaring 20s'.\n\nThere are so many exciting developments which have yet to unfurl from the study of computation, automation, medicine, space travel, electric/self-driving vehicles, and much more which we can't even fathom yet. One thing that has me incredibly enthused is the prospect of humanity's biological integration into technology. Perhaps it is that by 2029, I can be writing a blog like this simply by thinking, [rather than having to type](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqdo57uky4o)...\n\nMy goal for 2021 is to further compound my own knowledge of C.S. and programming, so that I can be an even more effective in my pursuit of bettering the world itself. I so badly want to be on the cusp of innovation, and hopefully I can write my 2021 retrospective with this goal already achieved!"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-retrospective"}}}
